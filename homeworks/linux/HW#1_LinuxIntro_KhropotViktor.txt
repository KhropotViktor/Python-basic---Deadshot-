1. Create `cursor` directory and `test.txt` file

                      mkdir cursor
                      touch test.txt

2. Copy `test.txt` file to `cursor` directory
                      cp test.txt cursor

3. List the files in the current directory, in ‚Äúlong listing format‚Äù.
                       ls -l

4. List all files, including hidden files, in the your home (~) directory, in reverse alphabetical order and long listing format.
                        ls -lar ~

5*. Rename the file `test.txt` to `new_test.txt` and then create one more `empty_file.txt`
Hint: Renaming is done using the same command as moving.
                         mv test.txt new_test.txt
                         touch empty.txt
                         mv empty.txt new_empty.txt

6. Delete the files empty_file.txt and new_test.txt. Note that your answer must be a single command and not multiple commands.
Hint: Many commands can accept more than one parameter.
Create hw.txt file under cursor directory
                    touch empty.txt
                    rm empty_file.txt new_test.txt
                    cd ~/cursor
                    touch hw.txt

7*. Set the file hw.txt to have a last-modified date of January 1, 2020, 4:15am.
Hint: The man page for the proper command describes the timestamp 'STAMP' format to use. Look for this!
Also note: Linux is case-sensitive when you are specifying file or directory names.
You can use a * (asterisk) as a ‚Äúwild-card‚Äù character to specify a group of files.
For example, *foo means all files whose names end with foo, and foo* means all files whose names begin with foo.
You can use a wildcard in the middle of a file name, such as foo*bar for all files that start with foo and end with bar.
                     touch -m -t 202001010415 hw.txt

Create hw.sh, hw1.sh, hw2.sh, hw1.txt under the cursor directory
                     touch hw.sh hw1.sh hw2.sh hw1.txt

8. List all files (only with the extension .sh) in the current directory.
Note that the ls command can accept more than one parameter for what files you want it to list.
Hint: Use grep
                    victor@viktor-khropot:~/cursor$ ls | grep .sh
                             hw1.sh
                             hw2.sh
                             hw.sh

9. Copy all the text files (files whose names end with .txt) from the current folder to the new directory `text_files`.
                     victor@viktor-khropot:~/cursor$ mkdir text_files | cp *txt text_files
                     victor@viktor-khropot:~/cursor$ ls text_files
                     hw1.txt  hw.txt  new_empty.txt  test.txt

10. Write `cursor` to the hw.txt file by using echo.
                  victor@viktor-khropot:~/cursor$ echo cursor >hw.txt

11. Display the contents of hw.txt
                   victor@viktor-khropot:~/cursor$ cat hw.txt
                   cursor

12. Change the permissions to 0 for current user and try to Display contents again.
            victor@viktor-khropot:~/cursor$ chmod 0 hw.txt
            victor@viktor-khropot:~/cursor$ cat hw.txt
            cat: hw.txt: Permission denied

13. Change the permission to rwx for current user only and try again.
          victor@viktor-khropot:~/cursor$ chmod 700 hw.txt
          victor@viktor-khropot:~/cursor$ cat hw.txt
          cursor

14. Write from 1 to 10 in each line in hw.txt by using text reader.

üîç Self Discovery: The head and tail commands output only the first or last few lines (respectively) of a file to the terminal.
           victor@viktor-khropot:~/cursor$ vi hw.txt
           victor@viktor-khropot:~/cursor$ cat hw.txt

15. Display only the first 7 lines of the file hw.txt from the current directory on the terminal.
           victor@viktor-khropot:~/cursor$ head -n7 hw.tx

16*. Create test.sh with echo 'Hello' and make it executable
          victor@viktor-khropot:~/cursor$ touch test.sh
          victor@viktor-khropot:~/cursor$ vi test.sh

17*. Execute test.sh
           victor@viktor-khropot:~/cursor$ ./test.sh

18. Search for a files with .sh in your working directory.
            victor@viktor-khropot:~/cursor$ find *.sh
       hw1.sh
       hw2.sh
       hw.sh
       test.sh
